## My process

My landing page creation process was to try to build the HTML as structured as possible and then move on to CSS, which is not complicated.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I better assimilated the content of the flex box and the organization of the elements on the page. But most importantly, I was able to find alternatives in times when things didn't work out the way I thought they should.

### Continued development

My goal is to keep evolving with CSS, at the moment practicing more flexbox. There were a few moments in building the landing page when things didn't work out as they should. I need to study the subject a little more so as not to be surprised again.
